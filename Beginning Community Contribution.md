**Beginning Community Contribution**

 - [ ] Look for contribution guidelines in project repositories

    
 - [ ] If something is unclear, raise a question in a communication
       channel

    
 - [ ] Get familiar with the project's release timeline and versioning
       conventions

    
 - [ ] Find issues labeled "starter," "good first bug," "low-hanging fruit," or "beginner"

    
 - [ ] Use a guided tool (like [What Can I Do forFedora?](https://whatcanidoforfedora.org/) or [What Can I Do for
       Mozilla?](https://codetribute.mozilla.org/))

 
  - [ ] Review tutorials like those at [Your First PullRequest](https://yourfirstpr.github.io/) or [First Timers
       Only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/)
